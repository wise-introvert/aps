[Logic 2]
During the shootout they agree to limit the number of attempts to 3 throws each. The game will be
constructed in two sessions. In the first session, the first student makes all 3 attempts and in the
second session, the second student makes all 3 attempts. The student who makes the most baskets
(gets the ball in the hoop) will be declared the winner. In the case of a tie, the game will be repeated
until a winner can be determined.
